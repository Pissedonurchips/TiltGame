3 Interactive player objects.
A dart which can be grabbed carried and thrown has collision and physics for all environment assets.
Crossbow which can be trigger shot producing a projectile dart.
blow dart which uses voice input as a fire mechanism.
A foam finger to which can be picked up carried and used to break objects.
dart board level selectors and the bottles are geometry collection assets utilising fracture levels to create the effect all of these are breakable.
The dart board has full collision with tags, so the announcer knows what score has been achieved.
This score is linked to the voice lines and animation track to ensure the announcer announcers the correct score.
The juke box are physics boxes all operating under a player blueprint script with 15 different sounds to change play pause sound.
The calculator generates a random number and then receives input from the physics buttons to work out the score and perform a comparison to check if the score has been achieved and how many darts have been used.
The trailer was edited by myself using music credited by the artists above, and edited in Clipchamp using standard Clipchamp transitions and text options.
There are three idents featured two are flags also included inside the game itself one for NTU and one for Cyprinus(myself) the developer.
A separate ident filmed using Unreal level sequencer of the NTU logo shattering when hit by the real-life dart.
The incorporation of real world and virtual world assets represents the relationship between the two.
